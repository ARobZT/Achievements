Service Enumeration: Gathering detailed information about running services to detect potential vulnerabilities.

Web Application Security: Testing web applications for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, or insecure configurations.

Exploitation: Using identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the system.

File System Navigation: Using Linux commands to explore the filesystem and locate important files or flags.

Privilege Escalation: Techniques to elevate privileges from a standard user to root or administrative access.

Password Cracking: Cracking password hashes using tools like john or hashcat to access protected areas.

Scripting and Automation: Writing and executing scripts to automate tasks or exploitations.

Log Analysis: Reviewing logs to uncover useful information or understand system activities.

Data Exfiltration: Extracting valuable data or flags from the compromised system.

Malware Analysis: Investigating malicious software to understand its behavior and impact.

Problem-Solving: Applying logical and analytical thinking to solve challenges and complete the room objectives.
